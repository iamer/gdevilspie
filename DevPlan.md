# Next 0.3 Release (Bugfixes) #

Are we gonna fix the not installed local copy bug? i think we should. or at least add a note that it won't run without installation.

the inkscape thing.. well, I dunno how we'll go about that one, but I won't label it WontFIX for now.

There's a comment on wiki that reports a problem on 64bit kde... we need more info before even getting started on that.

is khalid's work on i18n done yet?

# Where do we go from here? (1.0) #

Hopefully when phaeron (and me) are less busy we'll ponder on that.
